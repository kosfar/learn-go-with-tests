* In Go if a symbol (so variables, types, functions et al) starts with a lowercase symbol then it is private outside the package it's defined in.

* In Go, when you call a function or a method the arguments are copied.

* These pointers to structs even have their own name: struct pointers and they are [automatically dereferenced](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Method_values).

* In Go, if you want to indicate an error it is idiomatic for your function to return an err for the caller to check and act on.
